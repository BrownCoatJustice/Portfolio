# Portfolio

### This was not meant to be an open-source project, I like to upload the source code for most of my projects <br/>
<br/>
The source code shows the pain staking effort I had to make to center a div.
<br/>
The project itself isn't designed to be 'contributable' but...It simply is not contributable...Why would you contribute to make a person's portfolio ðŸ˜…
